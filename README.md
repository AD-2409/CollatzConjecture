# CollatzConjecture
The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns sequences defined as follows: 

1. Start with any positive integer n. 

2. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: 
  a. If the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. 
  b. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. 
  c. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
